# Teordle
Like Wordle, but in the terminal.

### Notable differences between this and Wordle
* You can enter any string with a length of five characters, user inputs are not limited to valid words.
* It pulls all its words from words.txt, no internet connection required.
* Okay? Okay.

### Using Teordle
* Compile it with just about anything
